Using the AWS EC2 AMI
=====================

To make installation easier, we provide an EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) that you can launch and
immediately begin using stackd.io.  Our AMI is built from an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS image, and is
HVM based.


Launching
---------

To begin, launch an instance from our AMI.  <INSERT AMI_ID HERE>.  After a few minutes, you should
have a running stackd.io server.  If you wish, you may point a DNS record at your new server
for easier access.
