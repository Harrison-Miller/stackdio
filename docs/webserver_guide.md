# stackd.io webserver guide

This guide will help you quickly get the web portion of stackd.io running behind either Apache or Nginx. You should've already worked through the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) before running through the steps below. As with the quickstart, our focus is not entirely on building out a production-ready system, but merely helping you quickly get a system stood up to become familiar with stackd.io. Once you understand how it works, then we can start hardening the system for production use.

So, with that said, there are two paths to take: Apache or Nginx. We recommend using whichever you feel more comfortable with. Some of us here like Apache, while others like Nginx. Your mileage may vary :)
