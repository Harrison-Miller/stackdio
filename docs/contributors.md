# Contributor Guidelines

We're hopeful that you'll find value in using stackd.io along with your existing tools to manage your infrastructure. We're also hopeful that you'll find ways to help contribute. Either through finding and reporting bugs, providing new features, or even getting your hands dirty and contributing some code or docs. However you feel comfortable contributing, we offer a few helpful guidelines to make it that much easier.

> Note that stackd.io is built on SaltStack, and we believe that its community will find stackd.io useful. As such, we're trying to stay close to the conventions and guidelines they've adopted to make it easier for folks in that community to help out -- and we've borrowed from the [SaltStack Development guide](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/hacking.html) :)

# Filing issues and feature requests

We want stackd.io to be solid, but there's always going to be issues to fix and new features to enhance the product. If you find any problems or would like to request a particular feature, feel free to head over to [stackd.io's issue tracker](https://github.com/digitalreasoning/stackdio/issues). Below are some general guidelines for filing issues.

## Bug Reports

If you think you've found a bug, here's what we ask of you:

1. Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/digitalreasoning/stackdio/issues) and/or [search for your issue](https://github.com/digitalreasoning/stackdio/search?type=Issues) to make sure we aren't already tracking the problem

2. See if you can reproduce the issue on the develop branch of the project to confirm we haven't already fixed the problem

3. Try to be as descriptive as possible when filing your issues. We'd like to know the operating system you're on, any stack traces you've seen in the logs, a good account of the steps required to reproduce the problem along with what you feel is the expected outcome. Providing more information is almost always better so we can quickly identify and fix the issue.

4. Be patient :)

5. Optionally, it would be fantastic if you could help us out and fix the problem yourself...if you're brave enough, see the [section below](#contributing-code) on contributing to the project.


# Contributing Code

Since we're using Github, the recommended workflow for fixing bugs, adding features, or modifying documentation is to fork and submit pull requests. The process is pretty straightforward, but if you're unfamiliar with Github, take some time to browse through [Github's Help](https://help.github.com/). 

In a nutshell, we'll need you to:

* fork the stackd.io project into your personal account [[Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)]
* make the necessary changes to the code/docs and issue a pull request. [[Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#pull-requests)]
* keep your local fork in sync with the parent stackd.io repository to minimize the chance of merge conflicts. [[Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)]
* and, if you're working on multiple things or your changes are going to be somewhat large, it's generally recommended to create a branch for each piece of work you're doing. [[Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)]

> NOTE: SaltStack has a [great guide](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/hacking.html) on how to work within their project and it mostly applies to stackd.io as well
