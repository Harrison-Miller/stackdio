Welcome to stackd.io!
=====================

stackd.io is a modern cloud deployment and provisioning framework for everyone.  Its purpose
is to provide a common platform for deploying and configuring hardware on **any** cloud platform.
We currently only support AWS EC2, but the driver framework is expandable to support other
cloud providers.

stackd.io is a `Django`_ project, and uses `Salt`_ for its back-end configuration management.
